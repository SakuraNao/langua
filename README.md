# langua

###This git repo is aimed to collect, save, record my language learning. All text here should be simple, clear.

####My goal is to learning as much as language as possible. It is going to update text here through my learning progress.

##Languages

1. German (**Deutsch**)

>I love Germany, and its language, culture. Even I have heard it is one of the most difficult language in the world, I decide learning it. *Bless ME*!
